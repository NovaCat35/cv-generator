## Challenges
In my quest to make my code cleaner, I've come across some tricky hurdles in TypeScript and React. Specifically, managing state variables and the mess of passing setState as a callback to components (i.e. prop drilling) has been a bit of a puzzle. I've been focused on keeping my codebase organized and efficient, but as I add new features, it's a constant battle to maintain that balance.

One big lesson I've learned is the importance of keeping separate components for reusability. It's a game-changer when it comes to adapting to new features and changes in plans. Each tweak and adjustment is a step toward better code quality, and I'm always on the lookout for ways to improve.
