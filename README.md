## CHALLENGES
In an effort to minimize redundancy in code with passing props and having template functions to cover many bases, I ran into a lot of typescript confusion with regards to state variables, passing setState as a parameter to components to be later use as callback, and good structure practices. So far, I keep progressing to fix these mistakes as I continue to change around variables and components as new features get added....
