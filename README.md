## Challenges
In my quest to make my code cleaner, I've come across some tricky hurdles in both TypeScript and React. Specifically, managing state variables and the initial mess of passing setState as a callback to components (i.e. prop drilling). In addition, while I strived right at the start to focus on keeping my codebase organized and efficient, the desire to add new features and implement new ideas to existing features soon became a constant battle to maintain that perfect organizational balance.

While initially puzzling, hooks soon became my best friend in this project, helping structure cleaner and neater in both state management and local storage saves. One big lesson to come out of this project is the importance of keeping separate components for reusability. In React, getting used to the separation of components and hooks has been a game-changer when it comes to adapting to new features and planning changes. Each tweak and adjustment is a step toward better code quality, and I'm excited to say this project really helped me step foot into the realm of React.
