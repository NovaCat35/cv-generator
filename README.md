## Challenges
In my pursuit to enhance code efficiency and reduce redundancy, I encountered challenges in TypeScript related to managing state variables, passing setState as a parameter to components for later use as a callback, and maintaining a well-structured codebase. As I continuously modify variables and components to accommodate new features, I persistently work to rectify these issues and improve the overall code quality.

As new features and plans are added and changed, I learn how important it is to keep separate components for reusability.
