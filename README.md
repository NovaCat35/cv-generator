## Tips for Users ✍️
>  When printing, you can set 'custom page' to 1 to get rid of extra pages and download the paper as a pdf by changing print 'destination'. (It is a good rule to keep your resume 1 PAGE!)

> While this CV generator features colors, usually most resumes are black but if you need to add color, choosing blue and black is a good bet.

> Search online for good resume tips. I found asking Reddit helped a lot (look online for advice, avoid paying for services, you got this). Also, you can use this CV generator as inspiration if you plan to do a more manual approach using Google or Microsoft Docs. This way maybe you can build your resume while drawing inspiration from the resume structure on this site.

## Challenges 😖
In my quest to make my code cleaner, I've come across some tricky hurdles in both TypeScript and React. Specifically, managing state variables and the initial mess of passing setState as a callback to components (i.e. prop drilling). In addition, while I strived right at the start to focus on keeping my codebase organized and efficient, the desire to add new features and implement new ideas to existing features soon became a constant battle to maintain that perfect organizational balance.

While initially puzzling, hooks soon became my best friend in this project, helping structure cleaner and neater in both state management and local storage saves. One big lesson to come out of this project is the importance of keeping separate components for reusability. In React, getting used to the separation of components and hooks has been a game-changer when it comes to adapting to new features and planning changes. Each tweak and adjustment is a step toward better code quality, and I'm excited to say this project really helped me step foot into the realm of React.
